Rave, you seem to know about as much about the Healthcare Bill as you do grammar. And since The bill is good for the economy. It's  good  for the Economy. And it's good for everyone. And because it will save money. We are the only Western nation without some kind of Universal Healthcare, and we have the worst overall healthcare in the western world and we pay the most for that crappy healthcare. And the bill will help us get better. Next, insured people are more likely to see a doctor, which in turn leads to people catching diseases like cancer before they are life-threatening, and before they cost hundreds of thousands to treat. And they will be able to get care when they need it. Which again saves money.  You see, uninsured people currently only have the option of going to an emergency room when very sick.

These candidates will inevitably run poor campaigns that focus on false and trite attacks that the electorate is no longer as vulnerable to due to a widespread internet and decline of a single, easily influenced mass media. Obama will then win by a clear margin.
