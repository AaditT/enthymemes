In my life I've seen children and teens be much better adjusted because they've had to go through not only the normal chaos of childhood with other children calling names and being mean but they've also had to go through what I might call an orientation that very few kids have...and that is that prejudice, hatred and a lack of understanding for the human condition so thoroughly exists in this world.

Rave, you seem to know about as much about the Healthcare Bill as you do grammar.  This bill will  decrease  the national debt by half a trillion over ten years. It's  good  for the economy.  You see, uninsured people currently only have the option of going to an emergency room when very sick. This bill insures the uninsured, meaning that hospital visit will no longer be taken care of by tax payers. Next, insured people are more likely to see a doctor, which in turn leads to people catching diseases like cancer before they are life-threatening, and before they cost hundreds of thousands to treat. Which again saves money.  Then there is the whole human life thing. We are the only Western nation without some kind of Universal Healthcare, and we have the worst overall healthcare in the western world and we pay the most for that crappy healthcare. # happy # Ensured better healthcare
I don't care if they dig up Moe Howard...I'd rather vote for him. # happy # We have better republicans than Obama

He ignores that majority of America doesn't want Health Care but he still pushes it through. Ignorant much?  Health Care is another way of  Theft  for the government.

A Fight I'm willing to have is Obama out of his mind. Does he really want to economy to get better? Why would he say something so asinine.

Are there harmful side effects of marijuana? Yes, but no more so than any other drug including alcohol, tobacco, or caffiene. # satisfied # Not addictive
If it was harmful, then why do so many intelligent people use it?. # like a good person # Not addictive
The simple reason is: Alcohol and Tobacco.  How can Marijuana be illegal, if Alcohol (which is much more powerful on the mind and body) and Tobacco (which is much more addictive) can be purchased in any amount, at almost any place?. # satisfied # Not addictive

Instead of relying on prescription drugs, marijuana helps with medical conditions concerning: Glaucoma, arthritis, cancer, pain, nausea, AIDS, Multiple Sclerosis, Brain Injury/Stroke, Anti-Tumor Effects, Asthma, Epilepsy, Schizophrenia, Migraine, and eating disorders.

What all these effects have in common is that they result from changes in the brain's control centers, located deep in the brain. "Deep brain functions separated from conscious thought processes. The deep relay centers feed information to the controlling mechanisms of the consciousness." So, when marijuana disturbs functions centered in the deep control centers, disorienting changes in the mind occur (I think that is right). The user's psychomotor coordination becomes impaired. One may suffer or develop illusions and hallucinations, have a difficulty in remembering events which just occurred, slowed thinking and a narrow attention span, "depersonalization, euphoria or depression, drowsiness or insomnia, difficulty in making accurate self-evaluation, a loss of judgment, and mental and physical lethargy. # happy # Responsible for brain damage

so since the BIBLE says it is not allowed then our Government shouldn't allow it? so what happened to the separation of church and state? the government is not supposed to support a particular religious view and therefore, to ban gay marriage because the BIBLE says it is not allowed, is a direct violation of the constitution. # like they are being watched # Religion should not be used against gay rights.

You can't argue that people or institutions are equal and then legally, and definitionally prohibit one group from participating in the rits of another group. That's not equal.
