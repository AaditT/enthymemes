Rave, you seem to know about as much about the Healthcare Bill as you do grammar. We are the only Western nation without some kind of Universal Healthcare, and we have the worst overall healthcare in the western world and we pay the most for that crappy healthcare. And since the bill is going to make the healthcare system more efficient and more affordable, and since the healthcare bill will insure the uninsured. It's  good  for the economy.  You see, uninsured people currently only have the option of going to an emergency room when very sick. This bill insures the uninsured, meaning that hospital visit will no longer be taken care of by tax payers. Next, insured people are more likely to see a doctor, which in turn leads to people catching diseases like cancer before they are life-threatening, and before they cost hundreds of thousands to treat. Which again saves money.  Then there is the whole human life thing.  This bill will  decrease  the national debt by half

What all these effects have in common is that they result from changes in the brain's control centers, located deep in the Brain. "Deep brain functions separated from conscious thought processes. The deep relay centers feed information to the controlling mechanisms of the consciousness." So, when marijuana disturbs functions centered in the deep control centers and the brain processes that are centered in deep control center, disorienting changes in mind occur (I think that is right). The user's psychomotor coordination becomes impaired.
