Rave, you seem to know about as much about the Healthcare Bill as you do grammar. We are the only Western nation without some kind of Universal Healthcare, and we have the worst overall healthcare in the western world and we pay the most for that crappy healthcare. And since the bill is going to make the healthcare system more efficient and more affordable, and since the healthcare bill will insure the uninsured. It's  good  for the economy.
