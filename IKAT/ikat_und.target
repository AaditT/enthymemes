Throughout the six or seven semesters, however, topics are covered that likewise ought to carry weight. And since In the current regulation on the calculation of the total grade, all contents of all semesters are weighted adequately. Current regulations for the calculation of the total grade should therefore be maintained.
But as long as the licence payers have no say in the distribution of the funds, the fee quite rightly annoys them. And since Everyone is obliged to pay the TV & radio licence. Not everyone should be obliged to pay the TV & radio licence.
as long as the motivation of those people isn't triggered by propaganda, corruption and military pressure. And since A reaction prevents propaganda, corruption and military pressure. A violation of international law should be more than enough to consider a reaction!
But even with that tiny amount you could do a lot of good elsewhere. And since Only a small part of the money from the taxpayer is spent on bank rescues. That's why we should not allow any additional bank rescues.
The doctor was able to sign him off as fit for play with enough painkillers, And since If a player is not fit for play, a replacement is required. We urgently need a midfield replacement for the coming match.
but that would only make the injury worse in the long run. And since In case of an injury you need a replacement for a player. We urgently need a midfield replacement for the coming match.
so this has hardly any effect on the level of full-time employment and the number of unemployed. And since Supermarkets and shopping centres hire temps for Sundays and public holidays. For these reasons supermarkets and shopping centres should not be allowed to be open for business on arbitrary Sundays and holidays.
Of course a certain level of secrecy is the basis for the work of intelligence services. And since Regulation prevents secrecy. That's why intelligence services must be regulated in the framework of parliamentary oversight committees.
these short-term fluctuations in birth rates don't change the general trend at all. And since The general trend shows that the birth rate is falling. and at the same time birth rates are declining.
even if there are actually designated in-house security forces. And since If there are good in-house security forces, police presence is no longer required. This is why we need more police presence in public transport,
one should not deny longstanding owners the opportunity to adjust their returns to market level. And since A rent increase upon tenant change gives the longstanding owners the opportunity to adjust their return to the market level. A cap on rent increases upon tenant change is therefore not to be supported.
but that hardly counts as a proper brawl. And since In a brawl you fight. I think Fritz has never been in a fight in his life.
A fine for leaving dog waste behind admittedly seems rather authoritarian, And since If you do not comply with a rule, you must pay a penalty. but similar rules are often in place for bicycles on park paths, after all.
but once they have to dig into their pockets, their laziness will sure vanish! And since A fine is paid out of the pocket. Higher fines are therefore the right measure against negligent, lazy or simply thoughtless dog owners.
But as long as it is unclear as to how this works, the funds should rather be spent on therapies where one knows with certainty. And since It is not known with certainty how treatments in complementary medicine work. Health insurance companies should not cover treatments in complementary medicine
but is not of top priority for employers. And since Employers recruit people on the basis of their grades. The BA dissertation should, if not make up the entire grade, then at least constitute a larger share of it.
yet it's precisely their positive effect when accompanying conventional 'western' medical therapies that's been demonstrated as beneficial. And since Health insurance companies only support treatments with a proven positive effect. Health insurance companies should naturally cover alternative medical treatments.
but cleaning up after their dogs does happen to be the obligation of the owners. And since If you do not fulfill your obligation, you must pay a fine. If there were higher fines for leaving dog dirt on pavements, there would presumably be less dog dirt,
but what's really lacking in schools today is rather a real sense of community, which would possibly be strengthened by an equal, collective appearance. And since School uniforms cause an equal, collective appearance. School uniforms should be introduced in our schools again.
but political power also brings about political responsibility, in this case the responsibility to protect the Ukrainian people from the rather strong interests of the two Great Powers. And since The EU has political power. The EU should exert influence on the political events in Ukraine.
Everyone should be able to get the utmost profit from his or her property. And since A rent increase enables the landlord to make a profit from his property. A constant increase in rent upon a change of tenants hence cannot be desired by society.
A fixing of rent prices according to the market alone, however, will lead to a further division of society. And since division of society is not desired by society. A constant increase in rent upon a change of tenants hence cannot be desired by society.
